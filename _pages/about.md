        <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Khari Hutchings, in 2023 I quit my consulting job in New York City and moved to Florida to pursue my dream of playing poker full time. Every time I tell someone I’m a professional poker player, the first question they ask me is always the same - so how much money do you really make?
        </p>
        <p>I wanted to create this website to show exactly that, the finances behind a professional poker player. On this website I’ll track my poker tournament results in REAL time to offer those who are following my progress the never-before-seen behind the scenes information of what the finances of a poker tournament grinder look like.</p>

#### My Poker Journey

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
    <div>

        <p>I first started playing poker on Facebook and with my friends in high school, but I didn’t start taking it more seriously until I graduated college. I had 6 months between college graduation and my first day on the job and this was when I first fell in love with the game. I spent the majority of these 6 months studying and reading every piece of material I could get my hands on.</p>

        <img src="/images/from_khari/serious_landscape.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 400px; margin: 20px 0 20px 20px; float: right; max-width: 50%;">        
        <p>By the time my job was scheduled to start, I’m proud to admit I was still absolutely <em>awful</em>, but I continued to play on evenings and on weekends where I could and eventually things began to improve. At a certain point I had enough money from poker, that I owed it to myself to take a shot at playing fulltime. If I failed, at least I would have a cool story out of it, right?</p>

#### Clutch Poker

        <img src="/images/from_khari/smiley_portrait.jpg" alt="Image Description" style="width: 250px; margin: 20px 0 20px 20px; float: right; max-width: 50%;">    

<p>
    
    When I started my journey as a professional poker player, I knew I wanted to make money (duh) but wasn’t sure how much I could reasonably expect to make. They don’t exactly give you a starting salary when you begin like they do in most jobs. I knew my personal results, and I’ve seen some vloggers post about how much they made or lost in a certain year, but I wanted something more specific to base my results off of and was frustrated that I couldn’t find it.
</p>

  
        <p>That’s why I wanted to create this website, to provide complete transparency to what the finances look like behind playing poker professionally. Hopefully this can help current and aspiring poker professionals get an idea of what it looks like behind the scenes to help them grow in their careers.</p>
