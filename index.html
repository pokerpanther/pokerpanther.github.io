		<h1 class="rly-make">So how much money does a professional poker player <em>really</em> make?</h1>
		<p>My name is Khari Hutchings, <em>aka the <strong>Poker Panther. </strong></em>In 2023 I quit my consulting job to pursue my dream of playing poker full time. Every time I tell someone Iâ€™m a professional poker player they alwaus ask me the same question - so <strong>how much money do you <em>really</em> make?</strong>
		</p>

		<p><strong>Well, now you can take a look for yourselves.</strong></p>
